		<p> As you stroll across the quiet Peruvian countryside, all you can see is sheep, hills, and more sheep. 
		As you glance at a particularly interesting sheep herd, you see some rowdy teenagers disturbing the sheep. 
		Then, seemingly out of nowhere, comes a colossal and magnificent beast with white fur that pummels the teenagers into the ground.
		After a while, the teenagers pick themselves up and run. The creature, known as a llama, snorts in disgust and walks away.
		</p>
		<p>
		Biologists classify llamas as Lama Glama, which implies this creature is part of a genus known as Lama. It shares the genus Lama with Lama Guanicoe, also know as the wild guanaco. 
		They are related to camels, although they do not have a hump and are only native to South America. Also, they are closely related to alpacas, which are notably smaller, and can succesfully cross-breed with them.
		Llamas are domesticated, unlike guanacos, and are mainly used by humans to carry heavy goods, although if overworked, a llama will sit down or attack its owner.
		Beware of its forms of attack, which can include biting, spitting, or kicking.
		</p>
		<p> A full-grown llama is about as tall as a human male. 
		Baby llamas are called crias and are protected in the large herds. The herds have a complicated hierarchy that ends with a head male, who has the important job of protecting the others.
		Llamas are very intelligent and can learn skills, like getting in and out of a car, in just a few tries. They communicate using humming, spitting, and body language.</p>

		<p class="ph">Interview With a Llama</p>

DemigodWolf : Hello, Mr. Llama, may I ask what your name is? <br/>

Llama : Me? My name is, scientifically, Lama Glama. But why would you care, you strange, bipedal, flat face creature? <br/>

DemigodWolf : No, sir. I meant your real name. <br/>

Llama : *Honk! Grrshhnwek! * <br/>

Llama : Sorry, I was blowing my nose there. Do you know how hard it is for a llama to blow their nose? Our legs are down here, and… <br/>

DemigodWolf : Excuse me, can we get back on topic? Your name was… <br/>

Llama : My name is Uhfrestegskree in Llama, but you can call me Bob for short. <br/>


DemigodWolf : How is Bob short for -- never mind. Hello, Bob, I’m going to ask you some questions.  <br/>

Bob : You already did. Hit the rimshot! <br/>
*Ba-dum tss!* <br/>

DemigodWolf : This is going to be a long interview. Phew! OK, first question : What do you like to eat/drink? <br/>

Bob : Well, when I was a wee baby, I liked alfalfa milkshakes (the milk was from my mum), with a hint of lemon. But now, that  *#%#*^& Farmer Joe only gives me hay. But occasionally, I do get treats. <br/>

DemigodWolf : Okayy, what -- <br/>

Bob : Oh yeah! Those milkshakes were so good! I loved them. But weirdly, they smelt of poo from the depth of the horse stables. Now that reminds me of the crocodile I rode in Peru. Or was that just a log? Anyways, there was this thing on the ground, in a hilly place. The thing was blue, and I spilled some alfalfa milkshake on it and it became yellow! I graffitied it with a spray can, and wrote ‘Caution, pee has fallen on this fallen item.’ That made other llamas stay away, and I chased them with it. But I don’t remember how I rode it, though. And then--- <br/>

DemigodWolf : Can you stop interrupting me? <br/>

Bob : No. <br/>
*Ba-dum tss!* <br/>

DemigodWolf : I give up. <br/>

*End of recording <br/>
